# Dero Web

Dero Web is a system for registering dero assets and addresses into collections.

## Collections

A collection here means a context in which its useful for addresses and/or assets to be grouped together, individually named, and to be given ratings/reviews.

For example, Private Islands was the first collection. To create a Private Island Profile is to mint an asset and register it with the Private Islands Collection. 

### Types of Collections

Address-Only; Asset-Only; Asset & Address; Mutable Registrations; Immutable Registrations; 1 name per address/asset; Multiple names per address/asset; 

Collections can have any consistent combination of these attributes. In addition, collections can have free registration, or they can have one or two token deposit requirements. These can be refunded or not. For example a collection might require a 0.1 dero fee which is kept by collection owner, as well as a community token deposit which might be immediately sent back to the user.

### Collection Ownership
Collection owners can edit collection type and registration price. Ownership can be determined either by address or by token. It is also possible to create a mini oao structure built into the dero web contract so that a collection has a ceo token as well as designated board tokens which can replace ceo if necessary

## .dero domain name system

.dero is a collection in Dero Web. It is open to asset registration only. For address registration see ".dns". The .dero collection allows multiple names per asset, and registration is mutable. This privateislands.dero PRIVATEISLANDS.dero, dero-islands.dero etc could all point to the same asset which would point to the Private Islands website. Registration of assets for the .dero collection costs 1 dns. After the initial period this will change to 20 dero. dns and dero are both kept by the collection owner. The ownership type is oao.

### Browser Extension
In order to navigate .dero names on dero web I have built a chrome extension

### Registering your .dero name
If you have dns you can register your .dero name to any asset you like including an oao, the most powerful and complicated option. If you go the oao route I recommend creating a new oao contract for each domain name. You can use the same set of role tokens for any number of oao contracts.
